# Bank Marketing Dataset Machine Learning Project
## The Task
The "Bank Marketing Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y). You can find a description of the attributes at the original UCI URL, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing.
In this project we build two classifiers for this data set: a decision tree, and a random forest. We use ROC AUC score as an evaluation metric to compare the performance of the two classifiers.
